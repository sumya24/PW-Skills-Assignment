    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Web Hosting:\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional hosting, you rent physical servers or a part of them (shared hosting, VPS) to host your web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resources (CPU, RAM, storage) are typically fixed, and you need to estimate your resource requirements ahead of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "You manage the setup, software updates, and scaling yourself, which can be challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional hosting is less flexible, and scaling may require migrating to a larger server manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud Hosting:\n",
    "\n",
    "In cloud hosting, your web application runs on virtualized servers in a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud services are highly scalable and can automatically adjust resources based on demand (auto-scaling).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud hosting is more flexible, offering pay-as-you-go pricing models and services like serverless computing (e.g., AWS Lambda).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud providers handle infrastructure management, updates, security, and maintenance, allowing you to focus more on your application.\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider the availability of data centers and regions to minimize latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security:\n",

    "Assess the provider’s security features, including encryption, compliance with standards (e.g., GDPR, ISO 27001), and Identity & Access Management (IAM).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that the provider offers built-in security tools like firewalls, DDoS protection, and logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ease of Use:\n",
