    "Elastic Net Regression is a regularized linear regression technique that combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization penalties.\n",

    "\n",
    "The L1 term helps with feature selection by shrinking some coefficients to zero.\n",

    "There are many features, and some are highly correlated.\n",
